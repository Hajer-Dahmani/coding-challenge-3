'''
My program calculates the percentage of plagiarism between two given sentences.
The user needs to type a sentence that has the same number of words as the original sentence(to type as well).
The program needs to get rid of any additional useless space characters in the input text(in order to have the exact number of words as the OS).
The program finds the common words between the OS and the IT (doesn't differenciate between uppercase and lowercase words).
The percentage of plagiarism is calculated:(number of common words/number of words in the OS)*100 .
Check if the percentage is greater than or equal to 50% and then write a correspondant message to each case.
